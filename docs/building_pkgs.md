![PKG_BASE_FOLDER](https://github.com/SMGXSCRIPTS/Dam.OS/raw/main/random/PKG_FOLDER.jpg)

[WARNING! WHAT YOU NAME YOUR FOLDER WILL BE YOUR PROGRAMS EXECUTABLE NAME IN THE TERMINAL]

Make a folder and make two files named "REQUIREMENTS.txt" and "EXECUTE.dmf".

These files are Required, and "CREDITS.txt" is optional, but what are these files purpose? Well,

CREDITS.txt:
This file contains your credits for the package, storing your name, phone, email, etc.

EXECUTE.dmf:
This file stores the Launch Command's used to Execute your program whether it will be C++, C#, C, Node.js, Java, JavaScript, Python, Bash Script, Tcl, GO, HTML, php, SQL, Lua, Rust, R, Kotlin, JavaFX, FSharp, Bun, Crystal, etc. And even loading Drivers.
[Keep in mind EXECUTE.dmf can only use GNU/Linux basic or installed commands. You cannot use a Programming Languages commands]
